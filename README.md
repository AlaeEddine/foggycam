ðŸ“¹  A tool to capture Nest video streams locally, without having to pay for Nest Aware. The current release is tested on macOS. Windows and Linux adaptations coming soon (minor tweaks required).

## How To Configure

Make sure you rename `_config.json` to `config.json` and add your Nest username and password to the file.

In `start.py`, additional configuration can be made to the `cam.captureImages` call. The following parameters can be specified:

- `produce_video` (**Boolean**) - determines whether a video is generated from the captured images. Default value is `False`.
- `clear_images` (**Boolean**) - if a video is being generated, determines whether images are being deleted after the video is generated. Default value is `False`.
- `custom_path` (**String**) - an absolute path to a local location (folder) where captured content should be stored. If left out, the default will be the location of the script.
- `width` (**Integer**) - the width of captured images. Default value is 1280.

In addition to the above, **if you want to capture video**, you will need to [download `ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and place it in the `tools` folder, in the script root folder.

## How To Start

Run `python start.py` after you configured the settings above. Exit by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
